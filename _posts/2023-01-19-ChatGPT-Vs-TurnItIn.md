## What Is ChatGPT?

"ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI that can generate human-like text based on a given prompt. It can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering." - `This response was generated by ChatGPT`

## What Is Turnitin?

Turnitin is a web-based plagiarism detection service that helps educators and students identify potential plagiarism in written work. It compares submitted papers to a database of academic content, as well as content on the internet, in order to identify any matching or similar text. This tool is commonly used by educators to check student papers for plagiarism, as well as by students to check their own work for potential issues before submitting it.

## Does the Turnitin Plagiarism Checker Detect ChatGPT?

Short Answer: No, here's why. 

ChatGPT is a language model that is based on a machine learning algorithm. It learns from every response it generates, constantly fine-tuning itself to produce more human-like text. Imagine a classroom of 100 college students who are all taught the same information. If you were to ask them all the same question, they would all give different answers. ChatGPT works similarly, as it is fed with millions of data points, allowing it to come up with unique responses. However, traditional plagiarism detection software such as Turnitin will not be able to detect plagiarism from ChatGPT, as it can change its responses in a way that is not easily traceable. Additionally, even newer programs specifically designed to detect ChatGPT plagiarism, like [GPTZero](https://gonzoknows.github.io/posts/Bypass-GPTZero/), will not be able to keep up with the vast amount of data these models are trained on. Ultimately, the company with the most data will have an advantage in this field, as seen with companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Tesla.

## Data/Results

I have conducted an experiment where I used ChatGPT to generate 20 essays, and then submitted them to Turnitin for plagiarism detection. The results showed that all the essays received a passing score, with very low similarity to other sources. This suggests that using ChatGPT to generate essays will be able to bypass plagiarism detection software such as Turnitin, as the model's ability to produce unique responses makes it difficult to detect plagiarism.
