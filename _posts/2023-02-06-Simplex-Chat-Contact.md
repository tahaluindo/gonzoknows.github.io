### Why SimpleX Chat Over Others?
Personally, I chose SimpleX Chat for mainly these two reasons:

- Phone Number: SimpleX Chat doesn't require phone numbers, meaning neither I nor the recipient have to provide our phone numbers to each other. I don't want to give out my personal phone number to everyone.

- Email: SimpleX Chat also doesn't require an email, and the reasoning is the same as for phone numbers.

These two requirements were the main factors in my decision to choose SimpleX Chat over other means of communication for a website. It eliminates options like Signal, email, etc. Although it doesn't eliminate the Messenger Session, I personally didn't want a messenger that looks like a hacker app with its green accent colors. For my threat model, it doesn't matter, as I have my socials linked on this page, etc. SimpleX Chat looked like the simple contact method of choice, as it supports both Android and iOS, which are all I need.

SimpleX Chat is likely to stay as it is very convenient for me. It allows my account to automatically accept message requests, meaning I don't have to manually accept new contacts to send me a message. Several people have told me they found it easy to reach out to me via this encrypted messaging app.

### Why Have I Established a Means of Communication?
I Would Have Never Thought People Would Want to Contact Me for My Posts and Guides

This site started as a joke, but now has become a side hobby. I mostly established a better means of communication than my website comments, YouTube comments, etc. because there are sometimes more questions than can be answered in a blog post, and I realized people have plenty of questions (which I don't mind answering, so reach out!). 

I also came to realize that social media, such as Instagram, probably isn't the best means of direct communication. For one, I turn off notifications on most of my social media because it breaks the gamification feel of the app and turns it into a normal app again. An app on which I can connect with my family from a long distance, as I'm an out-of-state college student. I don't need the constant notifications and the delayed notifications, which are programmed to be delayed to "keep you in the loop" and to mind hack your brain to feed it dopamine, aka the social dilemma.


### What even is SimpleX Chat?
So what is SimpleX Chat? 
SimpleX Chat is very similar to the Signal messenger used by celebrities due to its strong security and encryption protocols, celebrities Katy Perry, Eminem, Angelina Jolie, and even my Accounting II professor all use signal. SimpleX Chat is so similar to Signal, it even uses the same exact encryption standards called [The Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm). 

SimpleX Chat brings mostly all the security features of Signal, all without needing a personal phone number. This is the reason I kinda dislike Signal for none personal communication is due to the phone number requirement and I don't have the budget for a second phone number. 

For all the security experts out there, SimpleX Chat had a recent audit for its security back in October 2022 by Trail of Bits. This security audit can be found [here](https://simplex.chat/blog/20221108-simplex-chat-v4.2-security-audit-new-website.html)

Also, SimpleX Chat has a very cool new feature called "Live" messages. Which basically show what you're typing as you type the message in real time.
