## What is Proton?
ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email service based in Switzerland. It was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists from CERN and MIT who were concerned about online privacy and security. ProtonMail is designed to provide secure and private email communication, with features like end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and self-destructing messages. The service is available as a web-based application and as mobile apps for iOS and Android. ProtonMail has gained popularity among users who are concerned about their online privacy and want to protect their communications from surveillance and hacking. Proton aims to offer an honest and reputable email service by upholding themselves above industry standards when compared to other companies such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo. Who sell their customer's data (emails) to advertisers to get targeted advertising. 
`This is also why many government officials host their own email server.`

Proton Mail holds a very high reputation as they are not only rooted in Switzerland a neutral country, but they have been around since 2014. Proton also keeps all their services `open source`, which is when the background code of products is publically available for anyone to look at. `"Transparency is the only way to earn the trust of our community"` - [Proton](https://proton.me/community/open-source). In which this transparency has earned the communities trust, at the time of writing this post for access to my exclusive code for one month of Proton Mail Plus.

The free exclusive promotional code is linked above. This post isn't a paid advertisement, but rather one of just sharing to display there are better products than mainstream email providers out there. Just cause your email provider that you use or maybe this is your first email, you're about to create is free doesn't mean it's something to trust. As free in the digital era means you are paying for your data. Having a secure and reliable email is the same as having a secure and reliable bank. Your email in today's day in age is your digital bank for all things including personal finance, social media, careers, and even government documents. So why wouldn't you want that stuff to be encrypted? I personally use this email since transitioning from Yahoo back in 2017, and it's been great, as I've said before, this isn't a paid review. As I have to pay for it with my own money.
