## What is Proton?
ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email service based in Switzerland. It was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists from CERN and MIT who were concerned about online privacy and security. ProtonMail is designed to provide secure and private email communication, with features like end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and self-destructing messages. The service is available as a web-based application and as mobile apps for iOS and Android. ProtonMail has gained popularity among users who are concerned about their online privacy and want to protect their communications from surveillance and hacking. Proton aims to offer an honest and reputable email service by upholding themselves above industry standards when compared to other companies such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo. Who sell their customer's data (emails) to advertisers to get targeted advertising. 
`This is also why many government officials host their own email server.`

The free exclusive promotional code is linked above. This post isn't a paid advertisement, but rather one of just sharing to display there are better products than mainstream email providers out there. Just cause your email provider that you use or maybe this is your first email, you're about to create is free doesn't mean it's something to trust. As free in the digital era means you are paying for your data. Having a secure and reliable email is the same as having a secure and reliable bank. Your email in today's day in age is your digital bank for all things including personal finance, social media, careers, and even government documents. So why wouldn't you want that stuff to be encrypted? I personally use this email since transitioning from Yahoo back in 2017, and it's been great. As I have mentioned previously, this review is not paid as I am responsible for covering the costs with my own funds.
