### What Is ChatGPT?
"ChatGPT is a language generation model developed by OpenAI, which uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text responses to prompts. It is trained on a massive corpus of text data, allowing it to generate responses to a wide range of topics and questions, with varying degrees of coherence and creativity. The model has been fine-tuned on specific tasks, such as conversation or language translation, making it well-suited for applications in the field of conversational AI and natural language processing."
