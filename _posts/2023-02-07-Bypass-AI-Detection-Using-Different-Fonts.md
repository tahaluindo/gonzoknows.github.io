What is [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)?

GPTZero is a tool that uses certain characteristics of AI to identify when AI is being used. It looks at things like how difficult it is for the AI to understand certain words or phrases, and uses this information to tell if the AI was involved in creating a piece of text. It's like a "fingerprint" for AI, that can detect when it has been used.

## Introduction
Ever since GPTZero made headlines, I've tested the AI ChatGPT detection program to look for loopholes. I even created a [Python script](https://github.com/gonzoknows/GPTZero-Bypasser) to bypass this detection tool. Funny enough, all that's not needed, as all you need to bypass these popular AI detection software is an online font changer. 

`Note: Technically these aren't different fonts but rather they are different characters, this works because computers distinguish characters of different styles differently, but we'll call it fonts cause it brings better SEO`

### GPTZero Limitations 
In my honest opinion, GPTZero is a very easy tool for people to bypass. However, in reality, people don't even have to bypass it because it gives highly inaccurate results. It's shocking to me that educational institutions trust this tool at all.

## Step-By-Step Guide
Here's a short, simple guide to bypassing many popular ChatGPT detection software programs using a free online font changer. For this guide, I'll demonstrate it against [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/), as it's the most popular tool among them all. 

1. Generate your text with ChatGPT then `copy` your generated text, for my guide I'll be using the text below
    ~~~
    Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information and perform calculations, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) which can be in multiple states at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, making them well-suited for solving complex problems in fields like cryptography, chemistry, and machine learning.

    `Note: this string was generated by ChatGPT based on the question "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"`

    If we were to input a string of text generated by ChatGPT into GPTZero, it would likely classify the text as being generated by an AI.

2. Navigate to [https://www.fontchanger.net/](https://www.fontchanger.net/) with your copied AI generated text and `paste it into the white text box`

    `Note: If you are getting a lot of popup ad's consider installing` [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)

3. Copy any of the fonts listed in `Common Fonts`

4. Lastly, test your newly font changed text into any AI detection software of your choice, for my guide I am using [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)

    `Note: this font used to bypass GPTZero is called "Italic"`
