## Introduction 
Transvribe is an AI-powered tool built by [Zahid](https://twitter.com/zaarheed) to help users learn more effectively on YouTube. With its powerful AI embeddings, Transvribe makes it easy for users to search for any video and quickly find the information they need. 

Transvribe allows users to paste a YouTube URL and start asking questions. This makes it easier than ever to get the answers you need and learn more effectively. While cutting down on time for those long TED talks that you might have to take notes on.
