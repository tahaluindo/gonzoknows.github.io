# Gonzo Knows
A minimal, responsive, and powerful personal website designed to educate others.

## Introduction
Short Intro: I wanted to create a personal website that is simple, responsive, and effective in educating others. 

Long Intro: My name is Jacob Gonzales, though my teammates call me gonzo, which hints the name gonzoknows ~~even though gonzo doesn't know~~ but the knowledge in which I do know, and believe would be helpful. I created the site to help educate others on various topics. My site mainly focuses around technology as that is my field of interest even though that isn’t what I study in college. In college, I am a double major in marketing & business. Short but might be long career path introduction, I originally planned to go to college for computer science. I took an AP Computer Science class in high school learning Python, I barely passed this class with a B but in AP terms that’s an A on transcript. Many people would see this as "are you serious it’s an A, an A is an A." Though, Python isn’t a hard language when compared to bigger, more advanced languages such as C++ and C#. This what helped me decide on my alternative major marketing. Like I said, I always had an interest in computers and technology even from a young age, but I found myself very good at marketing, especially with organic results.

### The Unethical Infamous YouTube Channel Business
I started an YouTube channel which now that I look back at it, it was unethical as it was focused on game modding. My first YouTube channel was also my first little side hustle or business. I grew the channel focused on gaming to over 20k subscribers within a year. When my channel started racking in thousands of views per video, I knew I had to take action to turn it into a profit, despite making money through Google AdSense. It wasn't a guarantee, as the channel didn't even meet the minimum age requirement for running ads, as I was in middle school. This is what led me to join a team of developers who created these game mod menus. I did all the advertising for them and got paid generously in commission. This is called affiliate marketing, but I wasn't any affiliate, as I ended up selling my own products.  

### The Trend Market 3D Printing Business
I ended up creating .CAD files to manufacture and produce dozens of those fidget spinners in middle school. It was actually quite a success, as the school had a meeting with me about my popup shop business and demanded me to take my business off campus. I produced these fidget spinners for less than $2 and sold for over 25 dollars. I was importing my materials in bulk, which cut my cost of bearings and PLA (Plastic) down by a lot. Furthermore, I knew this was only a trend in the market, so right when I noticed sales slowly coming to a slow after 2–3 months of selling. Additionally, I started to produce less, so I wouldn’t be left over with a bunch of diminishing assets, or in other words, worthless inventory. When I felt time was done for this business, I sold the 3D printer for the retail price, in which it only diminished in value of $200.

### Business Overview
If you are wondering "what did a middle schooler did with all that money he made," well take a guess. I saved it. I saved 80 percent of what I made and when I turned 18, I put it all into a Roth IRA account. All the streams of assets from
- Google AdSense
- Affiliate Marketing
- Product & Equipment Selling

Went directly into a Roth IRA, though now I wish it was into Bitcoin or even Dogecoin. Funny enough, there was a time when websites would just give you Dogecoin to view their site, and I’m talking 100s of coins for free. This would have converted to 50 dollars during its peak. I used to have a large wallet with Dogecoin with hundreds and thousands of coins as there was a Discord bot which you could pay people in the currency. Unfortunately, this was lost many years ago. Anyway, moving onto my site.

## Site Details
Gonzo Knows is designed using the popular static site creator Jekyll and the Chirpy theme. The Chirpy theme was chosen for its fast, easy, and efficient setup process, as well as its great SEO capabilities. The site features a full site search bar at the top right, providing a convenient user experience.

In addition to its technical features, the site is also open source, with all code viewable and transparent via its GitHub repository. The site is hosted for free on GitHub, with the only cost being a monthly fee of $1 for the domain name “gonzoknows.com”.

### Site Navigation

My site offers multiple ways to navigate and find information. The most efficient method is to use the search bar located in the top right corner. Additionally, the top left of the site allows for searching by category, tags, and date posted.

My website offers a range of features, including:

- Automatic switching between dark and light mode, compatible with Apple devices
- Advanced in-text search engine for precise results
